## TL;DR
Hey, my name is Thwani Sithole. I am a software developer, and I am interested in anything 'C#" and 'JavaScript' :smiley:.

### About
I am a software developer based in Durban, South Africa. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and an Honours degree in Computer Sciences, both from the University of the Witwatersrand.

I currently work as a C# developer, with most of my work focused on web APIs and SQL Server databases. My interests lie in building web applications and system design. I've started this blog to document and share the things I learn and read about.

Besides being a developer, I play indoor soccer, and I enjoy trying out new places to eat with friends.
