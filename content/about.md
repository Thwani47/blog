## TL;DR
Hey, my name is Thwani Sithole. I am a software developer, and I am interested in anything 'JavaScript' :smiley:.

### About
I am a software developer based in Durban, South Africa. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and an Honours degree in Computer Sciences, both from the University of the Witwatersrand.

I currently work as a C# developer, with most of my work focused on web APIs and SQL Server databases. My interests lie in building JavaScript applications and system design. I've started this blog to document my learnings and also to share them and improve and possibly get feedback on my writing skills

Besides being a developer, I play indoor soccer, and I enjoy trying out new places to eat with friends.
