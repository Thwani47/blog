## TL;DR
Hey, my name is Thwani Sithole. I am a software developer, and I write about 'Go', 'C#', 'Azure', 'JavaScript' and 'Go' :smiley:.

### About
I am a software developer based in Durban, South Africa. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and an Honours degree in Computer Sciences, both from the University of the Witwatersrand.

I currently work as a C# developer, with most of my work focused on web APIs and SQL Server databases. My interests lie in building web applications and system design. I've started this blog to document and share the things I learn and read about.

I am also interested in and currently learning the Go programming language. I am also interested in cloud computing, focused mainly on Azure. I use React for most of my front-end work in my side projects.

Besides being a developer, I play indoor football, and I enjoy trying out new places to eat with friends.
